## 🧠 Introduction

A **Linked List** is a linear data structure where elements are stored in nodes, and each node points to the next. Unlike arrays, linked lists do not require contiguous memory and allow for dynamic memory allocation.

---

## 🔄 Types of Linked Lists

1. **Singly Linked List**
   - Each node points to the next node
2. **Doubly Linked List**
   - Each node points to both next and previous nodes
3. **Circular Linked List**
   - The last node connects back to the head (can be singly or doubly)
4. **Circular Doubly Linked List**

## ⚙️ Basic Operations

- Insertion (at beginning, middle, end)
- Deletion (from beginning, middle, end)
- Searching
- Traversal
- Reversing
- Sorting
- Detecting loops/cycles

---

## 📈 Common Interview Patterns

- Two-pointer technique (fast & slow pointers)
- Recursion
- Stack-based reversal
- In-place modification
- Hashing for cycle detection
